# farm

Introduction
With the increase in the use of mobile applications and online marketing platform, we see how farmers or prospective farmers can own a virtual farm, where they can easily sell their farm products as well as farm equipments. This platform gives farmers the opportunity to meet the global market at their doorstep without location being the barrier, farmers can upload products that they cultivate and services they offer for people to buy/order as well as farm materials which can be seeds, farm tools, fertilizers, fingerlings. Farmers/organsations  can also give out tutorials for  potential farmers to subscribe to. The system will first be implemented as a web-based application, then later we will develop other versions for android and IOS operating systems.
